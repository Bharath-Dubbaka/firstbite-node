<!-- DABBA LOGIC -->

Got it 👍 — thanks for the full breakdown.
Now I clearly see why the LLM may have misunderstood: your menu actually has two distinct product lines and both need to be explained separately:

1. Normal Café Menu (Regular Ordering)

All the fancy small bites, café coffees, juices, Chinese, soups, bakery, brownies, salads, paranthas, etc.

These are à la carte items (user orders them like in a normal café/restaurant app).

No subscription — standard delivery like Swiggy/Zomato style.

2. Dabba / Mealbox Subscription (Weekly Plan)

This is the special, home-style thali subscription, and the rules should be clearly structured:

Subscription Rules:

Weekly Subscription only.

User pays once → covers 7 days.

Renewal optional.

Meals Covered:

Breakfast (9am–12pm)

Lunch (12pm–3pm)
Dinner (8pm–11pm)
User can pick any combination:
All 3 meals daily
Only Lunch + Dinner
Only Breakfast, etc.
Flexible Delivery Time Within Slot:
Eg. user prefers lunch daily at 1:30pm → system remembers this.
Weekly Menu Preview:
Before subscribing, user sees what’s planned for the week.
Example:
Monday: BF – Idli, Lunch – Rice + Dal, Dinner – Roti + Aloo
Tuesday: BF – Wada, Lunch – Fried Rice + Gobi, Dinner – Naan + Chole
Menu is rotational + customizable.
Customizations Allowed:
User can swap selected items (e.g., Gulab Jamun → Halwa, Naan → Chapati).
Rule: Changes must be made 12hrs before delivery (else default meal applies).
Not all items are swappable, only those marked available.
Veg / Non-Veg Option:
Subscription can be pure veg or non-veg.
Separate weekly menu maintained for both.
Start Any Day:
User can start subscription from today or tomorrow.
No need to wait for “Monday cycle”.
Pause / Resume Option:
If user is traveling, they can pause meals & resume later.
One-Time Orders Without Subscription:
Even without subscribing, user can buy that day’s dabba/thali at the same time slots.
Price is higher compared to subscription.
Subscription = cheaper & hassle-free daily ordering.
Add-ons Inside Thali:
User can add extra items (sweet, sabzi, roti, drink) during subscription setup or on a per-day basis.
Multiple Menus for Lunch / Dinner
Eg. Lunch might have 2 variants:
“North Indian Combo”
“South Indian Combo”
User selects their preferred style for the week (or daily via app, before cutoff time).

✅ So the biggest thing missing in your original description (and why LLM confused) was that the dabba subscription is NOT the same as café menu.
They’re two completely separate categories:
Café = instant orders (luxury/fusion menu)
Dabba = homely subscription plan (simple thali system)
